<h1>Privacy Policy — NEO GUARD</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: March 2025</p>

<p>NEO GUARD ("the App") is a tower defense mobile game developed as a single-player offline experience. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of the App.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>NEO GUARD does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information from users. The game does not require account registration, login, or any form of user identification.</p>

<p>Game progress and settings are stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong> using the device's local storage. This data never leaves your device.</p>

<h2>2. Advertising</h2>
<p>The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use certain information to serve ads, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Device advertising identifiers (Android Advertising ID)</li>
  <li>IP address (used to infer approximate location)</li>
  <li>App usage data for ad personalization</li>
</ul>
<p>You can opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device settings: <em>Google Settings → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization</em>.</p>
<p>For more information on how Google uses data: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

<h2>3. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>This App is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will delete such information.</p>

<h2>4. Data Security</h2>
<p>Since NEO GUARD does not collect or transmit personal data, there is no user data at risk from our systems. All locally stored game data (scores, settings) remains on your device under your control.</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App integrates with the following third-party services, each with their own Privacy Policy:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong>: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.</p>
